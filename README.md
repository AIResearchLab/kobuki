# Kobuki ROS2 package

This repository and the [dependencies repository](https://github.com/AIResearchLab/kobuki_dependencies.git) focuses on merging all the public forks available on the original [Kobuki Base](https://github.com/kobuki-base) repositories and extending the work towards an complete ROS2 package for kobuki based turtlebot robots. Additionally a Dockerfile for kobuki system has been provided that supports both ARM64 and AMD64 systems. 

## Docker Usage

### Docker Compose based use

Add the following snippet under `services` to any compose.yaml file to add this container.

```bash
  kobuki:
    image: ghcr.io/airesearchlab/kobuki:humble
    command: ros2 launch kobuki kobuki.launch.py
    restart: unless-stopped
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /dev:/dev
```

### Setup for pulling container from ghcr.io and running

Clone this reposiotory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIResearchLab/kobuki.git
```

Pull the Docker image and run Docker compose (No need to run `docker compose build`)
```bash
cd kobuki/docker
docker compose pull
```

Start the docker container
```bash
docker compose up
```

### Setup for building the container on device running

Clone this reposiotory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIResearchLab/kobuki.git
```

Build the Docker image
```bash
cd kobuki/docker
docker compose -f compose-build.yaml build
```

Start the docker container
```bash
docker compose -f compose-build.yaml up
```

    ```

3. Clone main repository and dependencies
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AIResearchLab/kobuki.git
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AIResearchLab/kobuki_dependencies.git
    ```

4. Build the system with following command. 
    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

5. Set udev rule for kobuki using following commands and unplug and replug the usb cable.
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kobuki-base/kobuki_ftdi/devel/60-kobuki.rules
    sudo cp 60-kobuki.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

    sudo service udev reload
    sudo service udev restart
    ```
